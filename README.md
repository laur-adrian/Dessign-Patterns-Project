Project Idea: Online Restaurant Ordering System

Overview:

Design and develop an online restaurant ordering system that allows customers to browse menus, place orders, and make payments online. The system should provide functionalities for managing menus, orders, payments, and user accounts.
Key Features:

    Menu Management:
        Implement support for managing restaurant menus, including categories, items, prices, and descriptions.
        Use the Factory Method pattern to create instances of menu items based on user selections.

    Ordering Interface:
        Develop a user-friendly interface for customers to browse menus, select items, and place orders.
        Apply the MVC pattern to separate the user interface from the underlying business logic.

    Shopping Cart and Checkout:
        Allow customers to add items to a shopping cart, review their orders, and proceed to checkout.
        Implement the Observer pattern to notify users of changes to their shopping cart in real-time.

    Payment Processing:
        Enable online payment processing using payment gateways such as PayPal, Stripe, or a simulated payment system.
        Utilize the Strategy pattern to support multiple payment methods and encapsulate payment logic.

    Order Management:
        Provide restaurant staff with an administrative interface for managing orders, including order status updates and order fulfillment.
        Use the Observer pattern to notify staff of new orders and changes in order status.

    User Authentication and Authorization:
        Implement user registration, login, and authentication mechanisms for customers and staff members.
        Apply Spring Security for securing endpoints and managing user roles (e.g., customer, admin).

    Rating and Feedback:
        Allow customers to rate their dining experience and provide feedback on their orders.
        Utilize the Decorator pattern to add rating and feedback functionality to order items.

    Reporting and Analytics:
        Implement reporting and analytics features for restaurant owners to track sales, customer trends, and popular menu items.
        Use the Composite pattern to represent hierarchical data structures for reporting purposes.
